# Chain of 3 Processes in Rust

This Rust program simulates a chain of three processes, each handling messages in sequence. If a process can't handle a message, it forwards it to the next process in the chain. The program handles arithmetic operations, forwards unhandled messages, and logs errors.

## Features:
- Handles basic arithmetic (`add`, `sub`)
- Forwards unhandled messages through the chain
- Logs errors and unhandled messages at each process
